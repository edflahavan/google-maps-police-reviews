Hounslow Police Station,"This incident happened today (26th May 2022) by the great west road, Hounslow. Whereby I had stopped my car to pick up my kid from school, only a lonely lane. After about 2 minutes a police vehicle stops around 10 meters behind me on the same lane and issues me a ticket stating ""This is not a place to park"". I said to the officer, ""I am in no way parking here and am only here to pick up my child who studies in Lampton school"". to which his partner replies in a very rude manner "" As much as you care about your child, we care about the public"". I told him that I was not aware that I cannot stop here, since there are no signs stating so and if it is not allowed I am leaving. Arrogantly he made his partner issue me a ticket and left. Can a police officer issue a ticket when I am still in the car and ready to leave? If the police officers were so much concerned of the public, how come, he too parked in the same place and was waiting there even after I left. That space is not even used as a footpath as people tend to walk along the other side of the cycle lane where there are houses. The cycle lane is close to the lane I had stopped. I could not believe that I was issued a ticket for that location and circumstance, Whereby, by my stopping there was not creating any inconvenience to the public. It seems the police personnel had no empathy nor simple understanding. On one hand the police department say not to book thieves who rob from supermarket as the living circumstances are difficult due to price rise on the other side, they themselves want to snatch money out of people pockets to fill their kitty. They dont have enough man power to catch serious culprits, but have enough man power to issue speeding tickets hiding behind tree or to look out for people like me who unknowingly are caught creating an offense (as per the police). Day by day, many like me have lost trust in the Metropolitan police. Most of the police personnel, at least here in Hounslow do not care of the public. All they care is about them selves zooming in cars with the siren ON even when the roads are deserted. It is a very sorrowful and disgusting situation. The rating should not show a star as it does not suit the scenario.",1
Bexleyheath Police Station,"Visited Bexleyheath Friday, after moving out a year ago (I lived in Bexleyheath for 7 years). I was stopped by police for alleged suspicious behaviour apparently I was looking in car windows which is rubbish. Asked for ID, and I provided my driving license promptly. I was asked unnecessary questions like have I smoked weed, and when was the last time I smoked weed, when was the last time I smashed a car window. And was asked if I worked or not. Un-necessary question about if I work or not, it has no bearing on the alleged crime or anything.  I am 18 years old. I found the female officer, and the two male officers rude said they did not believe my story. When I said I was a victim of car crime 2 years ago and that's why we moved out, and I told them to check with the officer who were were dealing with, gave them the officers name. And one male officer tried to twist my words and tried to say I was there one who was smashing car windows! When I was the victim of it! And then I was told to go back to where I came from (near Surrey Quays). I felt intimidated and felt I was guilty to them from the moment they saw me. When challenged  about the alleged call,  I was told ""You are 30 seconds away from the police station"".  They told me to go home, and then said the other units know what I look like, and will be checking if I left or not. This was just trying to be intimidating with these threats when I had done nothing wrong, I was also told they would be checking the CCTV. Since then I have had no contact with the police or officers, so I assume they saw it (if there was any, couldn't see any) and realised they were in the wrong.
Shame I never got their names, else they would also be reported for the illegal search as well. They never identified themselves, but they were in full uniform with a marked police car.  I had no issue being searched, but they did not search in the correct manner. Overall some officers are nice, some aren't.  The station is fairly small, but cosy.",1
Bethnal Green Police Station,Never been to London before ' ended up at this station as a victim of crime ' front desk operator and his frmale colleague' practically ignored me ' refused to give me water refused me the use of a restroom refused the use of the telephone 'please remember I also had luggage to carry I think the front desk (officer is polish ???? Never caught his name ' or hers ' was given directions hand written to go to whitechapel centre where female desk worker assured me I would be safe this was a 40 minute walk with heavy baggage when I reached the institution I was'confronted by junkies ' homeless people ' males mostly ' I was terrified out of my mind and sought refuge behind the counter refusing to be put back into a volatile situation this is the worst police station   PC attitude needs to pull their socks up !!!!!!' PC attitude simply do not care about any public member walking into that station  bethnel green has a duty of care which lacks at the desk the polish or foreign desk pc if that's what his title is needs to be sacked along with his female colleague I have NEVER been so enraged in my life ' my basic human requirements were not met offered or asked 'to let a female who is lost ' upset ' and told you can sit here for an hour left me breathless I a uk citizen being talked down to like riffraff by this pair is totally WRONG ' I am forwarding an official complaint against this pair and remind them they are public servants only to serve the public show empathy ' to at least allow a phone call and a cup of water and NEVER to be treated like a criminal I am actually  glaswegian ' was on a visit to London was a victim of crime and basically was treated unprofessionally' unacceptably ' rude ' and the chief commissioner WILL read my complaint ' I am home safe and tired I cannot count the number of complaints I witnessed at my unfortunate stay but those 2 last monday will be getting a reprimand hopefully a long holiday ' one disgusted victim of crime,1
Croydon Police Station,After what's in the news I was horrified to find that a place where I have worked before and know these people and know that every one of them at absolutely Heroes most of the ex-military in some shape or form and for them to be put under the cosh that this is not right something went wrong and the custody Sergeant lost his life now I was trained on how to use handcuffs when I do indoor work and it's not right but it's gone on yes complacency is there because of covid-19 but we need to help guys we don't need you to intervene but what we do need is help with calming down situation I'm indoors I cannot get to Croydon 2 to lay flowers and show my respect hello Will when I'm next in London you have done the Stanground everyone is on at the moment due to coronavirus and humans are humans where they were wearing uniform or not yes professionalism comes into play in 100% of their work but covid-19 is put an added pressure on things and and please guys these people are putting their lives on the line for us you might be up to mischief yourself but what about if your wife or children are in trouble one day and you're not in the area who do you call the police so think about that when you're getting professional boundaries of respect if the police are talking to you they have to be be assertive and sometimes that comes across as arrogant and it's not as they have to be professional and I can't take too much in otherwise they cannot do the job so come on guys please help a long stay out of trouble but if you do get into trouble treat them with respect and they treat you with the same respect back if you have a weapon on you or something that can be used as a weapon tell them straight away don't take it out of your pocket let them get it you can do something called arrested and then be rested for the sake of a strip Search but that sometimes they just check your pockets in the street and if so just let them they're doing their job come on guys,5

There has been issues concerning loosing vital.. Missing statements.. evidence and never looking back at any past history to pass there judgment when assessing each report...

Islington Police Station,"Bit of a non-physical station. Maybe the Bobbies will soon be working from home via a screen.

Their number has been disconnected and to report a crime now one has to complete their forms for them by going online.

Without disrespecting such victims, it does appear from the form that priority will only be given if there's been a discriminatory nature to the crime being reported.

If you haven't been targeted or victimised for being deaf, dumb, blind, black or gay it appears one goes to the back of the queue. Which is fair enough, I suppose. As long as it eventually gets followed up before any hope of solving the crime has dissolved.

After spending 15 minutes completing their form online, it is submitted with a suggestion that they will respond in 48 hours.

If they don't, the only way to contact them is via Twitter or Facebook; all communications thus far are from a NoReply email address.

Not very comforting to those who don't have web access or who find technology intimidating.

**Update: 2 Weeks have passed and as well as auto-response emails I've had 2 emails from humans a week apart but they say the same thing: ""This has been sent to the officer in charge of your case and they should be in contact with you shortly.""
At this stage all I'm asking is that they collect the footage we have explicitly showing the alleged perp, full-faced and red-handed taking £Ks worth of our stuff. Obvs, there's not much confidence that if/when they DO get the footage, that they'll even look at it.
I guess they're busy with more pressing stuff.",1
Colindale Police Station,"Hi all, I have so much respect to all polices in this country UK and around the world but the Colindale police which is in Colindale belong to Barnet Council they've been so careless about my case.
My case: it's been a couple of months back  that there was a learner driver stoping behind a red traffic light, where I wanted to go through and when the lights went green he was still there I horned at him to inform him that the light is green you can go alternatively he called me w***** and he drove right in front of me cut my way.  I slaped his car bonnet to remove your car that I can go he came out from his car he kicked my right wing of the car and I have a dent in the car plus the wing mirror is loose too. I had to call the police to sort out the problem when the police turned up to the incident location, the polices asked us to drive somewhere safe to discuss what happened. we drove off parkd somewhere safe the person who kicked my car he apologized to me in front of the police's and he said that he will fix my car also the kicker gave me a fake garage telephone number that I can phone them and get them to fix my car. The case was running by the Colindale police but unfortunately the police didn't chase up the person and I still have his car details the police didn't pay attention for the road offences  at all. I would like to take the time to thank all London polices and specifically to Colindale police that they have been so careless. thank you so much Colindale police.",1
Edmonton Police Station,"Been a while now since my last visit. Don't think I'll be back. Solid bed, not really a pillow, more comfort of an arm chair. The blanket was more of a gym mat. The bathroom was awful, I wouldn't recommend a number 2. Cuz u will be stuck with it the rest of the night.

Strict no mobile phone policy. No WiFi or entertainment provided either. Not even a TV or Radio. Had to count sheep or play I spy which wasn't really environmentally friendly for that type of game.

Quite a few unwanted wake up calls in the middle of the night with other guests coming and going. Random rude awakenings and so on.

Food was awful. Tracker bar and the cheapest ready meal money can buy is about the height of it. Small cups of water provided only, one gulp and it's gone. After a heavy nights drinking u think they would be a bit more considerate with the amount provided, give u a jug at least. They don't really like to be bothered after they leave u to your room.

Check out was a nightmare, too many hold ups and empty promises of quicker check out. Just couldn't get out of there fast enough.

Got a free tracksuit though and got pushed out the door and into the street to show it off to the crowds of judgemental onlookers admiring your  new plain grey top notch no named outfit with your black school gym gutties.

Not a great experience overall. Definitely recommend avoiding this place. You would find more peace and comfort on the street.",1
Colindale Police Station,"Absolute rubbish service from an officer yesterday. Only one officer was attending the main desk through the three-hour wait—lack of empathy, lack of training and apparent lack of respect and communication.

He was unable to help me, and when I had given in a phone to return to the rightful owner as there was a conflict between myself and the family. The officer had redirected me to them and told me to hand it in myself or go to a police station closer to them - Harrow and have it to them. ‘We are not a parcel service/messenger service’, which I thought was absurd and downright unprofessional.

Your job is to protect civilians and prevent them from escalating situations. If someone has come to hand over another’s personal belonging, it’s the police's responsibility to have it back. However he suggested me to hand it over at Harrow police station? What sense does that make. I’m here in Colindale and you want me to travel to an alternative station to collect for someone else to deal with and wait another 1/2 to be seen just to hand in a phone?
When I explained this to him. He was asking me ‘am I taking revenge’ what absolute rubbish. He was just fobbing people off and was extremely unhelpful. An officer with such an attitude and arrogance.

I will be filing a complaint against this officer for lack of support.",1
Lewisham Police Station,"I was physically and racially assaulted today at a Chinese shop, I called the police because the lady threw my money at me when I requested it back since the food I ordered was taking three times the estimated time I was asked to wait  and I was not surprised that police was of no good to anyone,.

One of them was asking me not to tell him how to do his job , I was begging them to please check the CCTV Camera for evidence but they can't be bordered to do it because as we all know they hate our guts.( especially people of colour) every time we try to report something some them don't care.

one of the police man can not even hide his attitude towards me and I asked him, why do some police hate us so much, why put on uniform if you can hide your feelings towards some type of  people, they try to strangle our children when arresting them .I have a video proof for that one incase they want to deny it, is on my facebook till today.

Why are they getting into this job just to see the opportunity to treat some people different?
.
I told those two officers to their face although one of them was alright ,that it will be a very good idea for them to consider another profession since they can't handle some group of  people in this community, I think policing is a waste tax  payers money .May God help us.",1
Forest Gate Police Station,"“A police officer has condemned people who cheered a man escaping police after a confrontation which left two officers requiring hospital treatment.
The incident on Romford Road, Newham, east London, was filmed and shared on social media with laughter and shouts of encouragement clearly audible.

But SUPT ROY SMITH described it as a ""sad state of affairs"". THE SADDEST STATE OF AFFAIRS IS THAT IN 99% OF CASES YOU DON’T DO YOUR JOB, BUT YOU DEMAND WE SUPPORT YOU.
Supt Smith tweeted it was ""disappointing to see members of the public filming this and laughing at the officers"". THE REAL DISAPPOINTMENT IS A GROSSLY SUB-STANDARD POLICE SERVCE NATIONALLY

DET SUPT SEAN YATES said: ""Acting on instinct when approaching a suspicious car, [the officers] were confronted with two aggressive men who have intimated that they were armed.

""The officers put themselves in harm's way to protect the public and I would urge anyone with any information to come forward."" YOU CANNOT REALLY EXPECT PUBLIC SUPPORT FROM A PUBLIC LET DOWN AND BETRAYED BY THE POLICE
This attitude displayed by the public is indicative of every single serving constable of all rank.  They should each and every one should be arrested and charged with impersonating a police officer
IF CARLSBERG DID POLICE THEN THEN THE POLICE WOULD POLICE",1
Charing Cross Police Station,"Gave us food and clothes, but showers took a while (understandable if busy and no female police officers). Cool building space when you first go in the 'cage' after the pixie vans. My officers handled me with care by picking me up on all limbs but then shoved me on my back into the van lmao. One of the officers with me was 1324 and she was super nice, handled me nicely communicated calmly and friendly vibes like saying ""at least you made him (the sarge) laugh. I know sometimes this is a tactic to get you to open up however, she even said ""hope you have everything you need, best of luck, take care"" <3 The custody staff bringing stuff to me though was very agitated and frank haha, we think he's not mean but just really up-front and verbal, like he said ""you know what time it is? This is not a hotel service, It's sometime in the morning, something to 3 now""
""What time is it""
""I'll tell you when I come back......*comes back with food I requested-vegan breakfast and rice* it nearly 12, I'll check on you every half hour (meaning I can ask for stuff then), don't ring the buzzer ok? *I nod and say ""yes""* good.

One of the sarge's checking my friend out gave the travel warrent copy to my friend and we think that it's on purpose, so not the nicest sarge.",2
Dagenham Police Station,"was asked to arrive at the station at noon , took almost two hours to be seen. Miscommunication from the incompetent receptionist. Receptionist blamed me in an accusational manner despite the huge delay being due to her laziness to be bothered to ask the proper questions, such as reference no. Told me to wait for almost 2 hours instead. Also had an attitude and was rude once she realised her own error, side note- just because you do not like your job do not take it out on others, there was too much second hand embarrassment for the poor old lady. Received an apology via phone and was given a so called appointment at 9am 2 days later. Once again was not seen until almost an hour later, despite being the only member of public in the station for the most part and plenty of officers present. After all this nonsense my issue was dismissed and they did not follow the procedure i was told they would follow. Waited hours on more than one occasion just for a 4minute senseless conversation. Wasted my time and proposed time allocations for non existent appointments. Disappointing to say the least especially when a bunch of officers are present playing footsie at the back office and flirting with one another like children.

Brixton Police Station,"Worst experience a decent human being can have. Totally partial, biased, no one seems to take any responsibility for anything or help you access the information you desperately needs . I was DENIED SOLICITOR even though that’s the first thing I ask for when I VOLUNTEERED myself to go there and ended up in prison for two weeks because I didn’t know how to put forward and defend my case. Now I am fighting that case against Brixton police station misconduct in court although they tried their best to talk me out of it.
I never ever thought that police can have such prejudice, dismissiveness, lack of fundamental human courtesy, disregard, rude and cold! Sad to say that experience with them changed my mind about Met Police and lost all the respect for them.

I will update this review after the outcome of court case against them.

They don't even deserve 1 star.

3-4-2022

Further found out very recently that one of the officer from Brixton police station has had affair with my ex and hence he done all this.

He’s being investigated in the light of undeniable proof I have given to the court of law.

Once I get the decision I shall update.",1
Hounslow Police Station,"Put it this way if I feel suicidal and my mind is messed up I look at a sweaty decent guy in Uniform he should be wearing in Warfare talking about nice stuff and reminding me we can all beat our real demons if we look at what we have and if we don't get stressed out but talk or cry when we have issues. That is Everyone- any Creed or Background- this is a Force trying to meet impossible challenges on very shaky economic footing so claps and hugs please not a real attitude problem! Fantastic group of ladies and gentlemen without whom I’d have struggled hard to enjoy Brentford as it is. Incredibly supportive, intensely kind and very interesting and intelligent as individuals. I could not find a nicer or more friendly force to personally deal with- be it helping me out or helping me help others. I’m sincerely grateful and they deserve to be highly commended in my humble opinion. There’s not one thing I could say that wouldn’t recommend this service to the community. Committed, courageous and I’m extremely glad to have shaken hands with a young PC waiting for a McDonald’s on his very brief break- he was charming.",5

Kensington Police Station,"Reported a crime, was told a police officer would come to view the property and they called by Kensington police start  by an officer  who refused to attend the arranged meeting to check the property,  even though I’ve whittnessed people trying to break in, im at the property literally everyday in the day  light it’s fine but at night because it’s s basement flat and the lights don’t work and the window are timid and locks front and back  and door don’t close properly as damaged by the Housing Association work( Catalyst Housing ransacked my fathers home leaving it dangerous so my father could not even pass away there after battling cancer as unsafe) I got two crime reference numbers, Catalyst will not do the repairs so I can live there and the police will not support the crimes what a disgrace.

This police officer refused to go to my dads property and said they are also unable to board it up and it not a crime. Where’s the duty of care here,  either my dads property needs to needs to be robbed or I need to be actually attacked for either of  them to help. Where our public duty of care. DISGRACE",1
Bexleyheath Police Station,"My dog was siezed in February, he's been proven to be totally innocent. No updates despite efforts to make contact, including visiting the station. Been told he passed an assessment awaiting conditions of return. He's never bitten anyone, accidentally scratched a snowflake with his paw who tried to pick up her little dog when ours ran over. Incident happened in Nov 21, so clearly the lady was determined to see our dog penalised since they didn't sieze him until Feb 2022. We have made an official complaint. It's the total lack of information, not returning e-mails, the officer when I visited police station recently assured me he would get the sargeant of the PC handling the case. Now have resorted to making a telephone complaint. This whole system is an absolute joke. Disgustingly unfair. Effectively a member of our family rescued in April 2021 from harm siezed by police for accidentally scratching the wrist of another dog owner..... It's a total lack of attention and information. Struggle to undersand how police get away with this behaviour?",1
Kensington Police Station,Wish if there was an option of No star. I went to attest my photos for my travel document and according to guidelines I can go to a police officer and as I live around the corner and I thought it would be actually better plus my bank manger suggested me to go to the  police station as they dont do it either. The police officers first of all didn't know then they said they don't know me personally and they are not allowed to.I showed them home office guidlines that certain people can attest who should not me my relatives. But one police officer kept saying he doesnt know me for 7 years and didnt even bother to look at the paper I had where it said to confirm that the photos are true likeness of me and thats all. The lady officer said why i didnt go to my doctor. I said well it also says police officer so why not you. It was ridiculous. If the police  is not allowed to say my photo is mine and confirm my identity then who can ?? I dont belive this as if it was true then why home office will say in their guidelines to go to them.,1
Stoke Newington Police Station,"Tucked away on Stoke Newington High Street I found myself with little option but to check into this charming looking boutique hotel. Unfortunately my stay was anything but favourable. The rooms were a disgrace. The white walls and lack of furnishings gave it a cold, almost cell like feel. The bed was rock solid and the mattress virtually non-existent. The proximity to the outside wall meant the room was constantly cold – and I had to request additional blankets from the night porter. The breakfast looked like it was reheated by Chef Mike – and was extremely unappealing. Such a shame - as this place has so much potential. A refurbishment is sorely needed. If not for the exemplary conduct of the hotel staff - this would have been a wasted journey. They typified the attitude required to run an establishment like this; being both helpful and humorous. All in all I’d give my stay at Hotel Stoke Newington Police Station a rating of 3 stars out of 5. I’ve stayed in worse places – but I hope not to be back anytime soon.",3
Sutton Police Station,"I was arrested due to my drunk & 'bipolar' friend threatening me with knife & then when I rang Police she accused me of everything under the sun! Arresting Officers were incredibly nice to Me & took my disabilities into account. Spent about 20 hours - 4pm-12pm - in Cell, with two breaks to see the on call Doctor. Wasn't able to get comfortable or sleep. Staff talked to me frequently throughout the night & brought me regular food & drinks. Incredibly polite & responded to all my requests. Made myself & my Appropriate Adult feel comfortable & when I was released with no charge, we thanked them for their consideration. I'll be sending them a Xmas Card this year! X-D
Two gripes: Food far too salty for me & made me feel ill & toilet completely unsuitable for someone with my health issues to defecate & clean myself afterwards.

Oh & are all Holding Cells identical? I counted 1,074 Tiles in mine & wanted to see if they were all the same?

Overall in my case , bloody well done Sutton Police Custody !",4
Islington Police Station,"Just I back from Islington police station waiting for 2 hours 44 minuets,  Including me totally 4 people’s only waiting area. How police working??? But doesn’t help me , wasting of my time .
I am shop owner ( I am woman) , Someone try to scare me , So I been to police station to report.

Stoke Newington Police Station,"Rubbish of a police station if you think this place is five star you might also think eating two slices of bread with cheese and ketchup is the best meal you ever had. I went over there today I was giving a letter regarding an   incident that I have so little a part of, so the police can investigate. Went over there 12:45 (roughly) waiting in a queue which some of the people where waiting over there for hours. No one would be at the front to serve you ""because"" they are at the back trying to pick ""info"" of your visit. Hours went by I got frustrated then suddenly a person comes out and tells us the reason of the delay, telling us in the ""21st century"" the police station operates only ""TWO"" computers to get people's info of their visit. Then finally came my turn after 4 hours of wait, then was told by the police that was meant to investigate the case he is unable to investigate today. Wasted my time wasted my money just to hear that, GRANDPA/stone age of a police station terrible",1
Twickenham Police Station,"My granddaughter Elsie who will be four in July and I were in Hampton Court Palace on Tuesday 13th June 2017 and we were told that the Queen was coming. Whilst we were waiting we were able to speak to two really lovely policemen, I think one of them was called Ken, I feel really bad for forgetting their names, they were so nice and really kind to Elsie and one of them even carried Elsie and he told us that he has a young son and I took their photos. They told us that they were from Twickenham Police Station. Elsie was just so thrilled, she just could not stop talking about the two policemen and also how she waved her flags as the Queen's car drove passed us. I would just like to say thank you to all those policemen and policewomen who were there that afternoon. You are all a great group of people and I know sometimes you get such negative feedback from the public but really I have nothing but praise and admiration and thanks for all the good work that you all do.",5
Forest Gate Police Station,"My experience has been this IS A VERY GOOD POLICE FORCE & STATION.  I have ALWAYS BEEN DEALT WITH LENIENT & TOLERANT OFFICERS. They look at the situation.. NOT JUST THE LAW. When I have needed help in the last 30 years this police force has ALWAYS COME TO HELP & RESCUE..  WELL DONE FOREST GATE POLICE STATION...I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH OF THE GOOD IN YOUR FORCE.  Yes ques at the desk can be a problem, but thats not their fault government cut backs.

I WOULD GIVE YOU 200 OUT OF 100 IF I COULD, your leniency in small matters goes a long way to help people come on the right track - rather than penalise and punish all the time.  ONCE AGAIN 1000 TIMES THANK YOU...you attended when, my house got robbed - officers were very very sympathetic.   You attended when my son went missing, they found him, you attended when their was a parking dispute with the neighbour and it was resolved.

Hayes Police Station,I have my phone stolen so i contacted police then i did investigation myself and found it is in cash converters. I told them that i found my stolen phone but they dont do nothing about contacted them multiple times police man in reception suggested me to give up on this case it is too difficult for them. I did more investigation and found out that cash converters knowingly sell stolen items and are covered up by ignorance of police because it is to big job for them because cash converters buy and sell stolen gods on daily bases. After time police can close the case on lack of evidence. I really disappointed on police work. I suggest they should close up this police station. I would be better of sorting out my things if there would be no police. Now i'm hopeless because cash converters is covered by police they protect thifs... This is only occasion i turn to police in my life and they surprised me i could think of anything but this is ridiculous.,1
Hounslow Police Station,"Dealt with my enquiry of a lost tablet cctv where it was taken but they said there was no evidence had a lot of personal pictures of my family i seen the person take it but due to it being to them too much time to go through cctv they took the word of the male pharmacist and never bothered looking into cctv i lost all my pictures that were of people that mean the world to me i understand they hv a lot to deal with but thats no excuse i question if it was there belongings theyd do all in their power to make sure the individual was brought to justice as their family and life would be on the line but as i dont wear a uniform its different but if that device was in the wrong hands due to past DV issues i had to learn to live in fear not nice from a normal human being that suffered at the hands of abuse and also my daughter thatcsufferd alongside me i dont play the victim maybe if i did id get more support thats a disgrace in my opionion.

Bexleyheath Police Station,"I have been nicked so many times since the lockdown period, i have to say the staff at bexleyhesth police station are simply amazing, they are generally jovial with a great sense of humour but still keep the level of proffesionalism required  not to mention their duty to care for the people that are in detention there me being one of them, the jailers are brilliant and attend to ensuring detainees are fed and hydrated or get their cups of tea or coffee, ive only been out for an hour or so and miss them already, the custody suite is such a laugh at times when they are not under so much pressure, my only complaint would be that steak chips and a pint aint on the menu lol. The service at bexleyheath custody is better than some hotels i have satyed at, Sending thanks praise and good will to all the staff that are in my opinion great human beings, yeah you get the odd bellend but come on every trade has them aye ;)

Sutton Police Station,"Had an Inspector investigate my allegations of Corruption & Mail-  Practice  within the Croydon Police . She removed most of my complaints, without my consent or Knowledge. It would appear that this women has educational problems. Sometimes she can read, sometimes not. Sometimes she can retrieve computer evidence supplied, Sometimes not. I thought they where meant to have good eyesight,  apparently, only when it suits them. When I replied via a email address, freely given to me, Her Ladyship  replied back that she was offended by my comments and that if I contacted her again in anyway, she would have me arrested. We need to build more Prisons & put all people in the criminal / civil INJUSTICE system in them. They must be interrogated, until we get the TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, from them. Do not know what to do now. Should I contact the I.P.P.C., OFSTEAD, or the R.S.P.C.A.",1
Ilford Police Station,"I HAD A NEED TO REPORT A  SUNKEN MANHOLE WHICH WAS CAUSING SOME PROBLEMS AT THE GEORGE IN WANSTEAD  E11.HAVING WITNESSED A NEAR MISS BETWEEN A CYCLIST AND 2 CARS I RUSHED HOME TO PHONE ILFORD POLICE STATION.AS TOO EARLY FOR COUNCIL,I WAS INFORMED THAT I COULD ONLY EMAIL?

Lewisham Police Station,"Arrived here to report a hate crime and understandably nervous but the receptionist put me at ease straight away. Nice to have someone there who came across as someone who knew the local area & the local people, good and bad. When it came to taking the details of my report this was done by another member of civilian staff I felt this was brilliantly done with sympathy and some important advice. Things rather fell down when I actually got round to being a police officer. The technology was clearly outdated as he struggled to type in the information then wandered off to get a keyboard to attach to his tablet. The whole reporting process took a lot longer than it should have and at times I felt he gave an impression of disinterest and was not giving the crime the attention it deserved. Thankfully it has now transpired that after review the case is being pursued. I’m awaiting developments.",4
Walworth Police Station,"My first encounter with being 'the wrong side of the law', (XR Rebellion).

I found everyone I interacted with to be professional and respectful.

Yeah... being put in a cell for the first time was a bummer, but it is the politicians that are at fault and let's not ever forget we're going to need people such as this more than ever, in the very near future, as our society disintegrates due to Climate Change and Biodiversity Loss.

I could never do their job... It's a thankless task... So I sincerely hope the Officers and Staff I met at Walworth Police Station will manage to maintain as much moral integrity as they can (& humour!) as the political pressure increases exponentially for those in their position to act inappropriately.

Good luck Walworth Police Station!!  You are all, (as well as the rest of us!!), going to need to stay aware as to what is really going on around us!!",5
Kingston Police Station,"Some of the officers are great, the seasoned ones with experience are second to none hense two stars. Some of the younger ones are brash, tease and totally disregard all SEN training. Mental health is being championed in the press but as always in reality are being misunderstood, undertrained and disregarded. Shame, where an understanding was achieved years ago has now been undone and underfunded. Welcome back to more joining the prison club, Kingston Upon Thames are now joining the ranks to put away innocent mental health patients alongside ruthless lawbreakers. Shame they get a kick out of taking the piss, keep going and we’ll have bigger problem with people trusting authorities. Having always advocating the local authorities I now have to admit to my SEN child that Police comments weren’t true or necessary. Shame, whish I could have proved otherwise. :(",2
Croydon Police Station,"(Translated by Google) I just watched a video in which some unscrupulous individuals in police uniforms with white shirts were terrorizing a citizen with a Drone. I've seen the lie, the imposture, the gangster attitude, but I haven't seen professional cops for a moment. There are growing examples of violations of the law and civil rights by this place. Soon you will behave like the police in Russia. From France

Plumstead Police Station,"Fortunately I have never needed to venture into the building. However, the problems caused for local residents trying to legally park their vehicles are massive.

Before the Police moved in parking was not an issue. However, due to the amount of staff at the place & their unwillingness to park occasionally in streets slightly further away, parking is nigh on impossible. Senior management at the station have been made aware of the issue & resident's feelings, but have blatantly stonewalled the community & refuse to take any action to resolve the issue.

I have given up hope of ever parking in my street again, and with a new Library & Sports Centre being built in my street at least I have the comfort of knowing that Police staff will also suffer trying to park..........which will eventually push the parking issues further afield.",1
Tottenham Police Station,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Unfortunately google require you to give at least 1 star which this station certainly do not deserve. I had a very traumatic incident happen to me, I was advised by 101 to go into this station and give a statement. I was given a CAD number to quote upon my arrival. When entering the station none was in there but the reception stank of weed. I was then greeted by an extremely condescending individual who stated they had no record of my conversation with 101 and that they don’t make appointments to take statements. She didn’t even take the CAD number and I chose to leave as I feel she was goading me into losing my temper but I remained calm as I was aware of what she was trying to do. I put in a complaint and waiting on a response. She was a PCSO light skin woman working the evening of 1/05/2021",1
Sutton Police Station,"I didn't enjoy this bed and breakfast. It all started when the hotel transfer van arrives, all guns blazing, the seatbelts in the back of the van are weird because they cuff your wrists together. The bed was lumpy with no covers, and the en-suite was in the same room as the bed. The hotel runs a strict curfew that says you're not allowed out of your room until they come and let you out. You had to be supervised to go to the shower. Weren't allowed any outside food and drink. The decor was extremely plain and the staff were quite blunt and wouldn't accept my list of improvements. I don't know which Michelin star restaurant the chefs came from but they outright refused to cook me a medium rare sirloin, then when I asked if there was room service, they laughed?! My advice, just get a minicab to the nearest Premier Inn in future",1
Bethnal Green Police Station,"Despite the arresting officer being quick to withdraw his taser without due cause, as I wasn't being threatening, violent or even trying to get away.
I was treated alright. Room service is complementary, there is toilet in evey room, no wash facilities though, but showers and hand basins are available on request, there is no free WiFi for guests.
No on site entertainment, my recommendation is the codes of practice, or I suggest counting the tiles. A Complementary phone call, if lucky.
Beds are hard, and the pillow provided is like a rock.
The lights are constantly on, and if you request they will dim them down but won't turn them all the way off, which can be torture!
Free change of clothes provided, but trousers normally come up short, and only plimsolls are provided, even though they insist on taking your shoe laces...",5
Charing Cross Police Station,"I’m just writing to advise, if you need to change your address late because you are a immigrant from some countries (which itself is an outdated policy and discriminating) don’t come to this police station. I reported the move after 14 days not 7. This happened quite frequently actually because they closed most of police stations and I need to work from 8am to 8pm including commute time. I took my earliest possible chance to find any station I can reach and they didn’t show any understanding and wrote on my PRC form “late to report the change” which will have negative impact on my future VISA status. UK please don’t close your police stations and make the remaining ones overloaded, which in turn make them hate the real tax payers. And please abolish the outdated discriminatory regulations from like 100 years ago.",1
Plumstead Police Station,"Quite awfully inept at this station. Mentioning no names, just last week many visitors observed 2 officers arguing in the foyer over the one computer they both wished to access @ the same time. .
Personally had the misfortune to deal with a few of their officers who never can understand the whole picture transpiring before thier very eyes.
This station Still retains a mobile phone of mine 2 years on after false allegations were made against myself & others.
The DI who is still just a DI btw, waited to close the store on my last visit. It's k I made myself at home watching everything while present.
Gonna go same way as Sidcup & all the others who didn't adhere, when get round to it.

Btw Plumstead's anti litter campaign wasn't Supposed to include ""hate"" in it's Title. This must be Changed by the Council. I",1
Kingston Police Station,"The other day there happened to be a crash on Penrhyn Road and the whole of the road was sealed off as well as the pavement and entrances to peoples houses. Just wear they sealed off was the entrance to my apartment building. I tried to call over a policewoman and ask hew how as I able to access the building. Instead of politely telling me that I had to go around a certain way, she gave me me the most disgusting attitude and got mad for no reason. I've looked at the reviews for this station and I have seen may people complain about the attitude of this station. Its disgusting to know that grown men and women honestly think they have power over others, do what they want and treat people in such a repulsive way just because of a tiny badge? It makes me laugh. Fix yourselves up. Its embarrassing.",1
Hounslow Police Station,I had my car Hit and Run in Hounslow so I immediately went to the police station I said to a constable my car was hit and run can I report it he said did I get the reg I said yes he asked where it happened I told him he said have I told my insurance I said no I just came straight here as it wasn't an accident he hit and run me which is a crime he said call your insurance. I called my insurance for an hour then then lines closed so went back in and said is there nothing I can do my insurance isn't answering he said no call them and come back. I've never been in this situation before but I looked up what to do and you are meant to go straight to the police and report it and they give you a crime number to give the insurance so how am I going to call insurance with no number what a joke!!!,1
Wimbledon Police Station,"Stayed in the establishment a few years back. The beds are rock solid and the blue mattress is smelly. Room service is ok but avoid the all day breakfast meal provided. Staff at custody counter very nice and welcoming. The stainless steel toilet could do with upgrading. No WiFi which is a shame. Queried why I had to have my photo, fingerprints and DNA taken when booking in, but staff insisted it was part of their terms and conditions. Complimentary Grey tracksuit provided for free which was a real bonus. Got woken up by staff for an interview in the middle of the night which was slightly annoying but staff courteous enough to provide a weak as piss coffee as a gesture of goodwill. Regular shuttle bus/excursions to Wimbledon Magistrates court provided with compliments from management.",4
Charing Cross Police Station,"Excellent central London location within easy reach of the bright lights and attractions and once you have made you way indoors you are unlikely to want to leave. The reception procedure seems a little formal to be honest, being asked if you want to read the ""codes of practice"" and being frisked is a new one but each place has quirks! The rooms have a certain retro minimalist chic about them (if you have ever stayed in a Holiday Inn you will be familiar) and have efficient room service. The place is so popular it is impossible to book in advance!... it must be good then. First come first served here and bizarrely incudes free legal facilities if you need them in a kind of Russian roulette approach to solicitors (1 in 4 chance of getting a good one). Premier Inn could learn alot!",5
Ilford Police Station,"On the 31st of August I was driving along the a406 at Woodford where I saw a man fall from a bridge after spending 3 hours with the police and giving up my dash cam for evidence as of today Im still waiting for the SIM card to be returned as for the camera it self I had to make 3 trips from Ongar to Ilford before I finally got it back last week Dan at the property office informed me that the police are not a delivery service well guess what Im not a collection service, this whole episode as been a disaster trying to get my property back you would think that after assisting the police with this terrible incident that the very least they could do was to assist me in getting my property back, no officers or anyone connected with this case has even bothered to contact me,",1
Kentish Town Police Station,"This is the worst experience I ever had with metropolitan police. I need a police registration certificate urgently and I arrived at Kentish Town police station around 4:20pm with my face mask. As soon as I arrive at the police station and said my purpose for visiting. The black officer lady said to me immediately go home not even until I finished my words. I tried to explained to her that I need it urgently for my visa application. She is still turning me away by keeping saying they won’t do anything for the certificate because of the COVID.

Then I said how can I said to the immigration officer, she said just told them we can’t do anything because of the COVID. They don’t even have a number I can call to confirm whether I should make an appointment beforehand.",1
Tottenham Police Station,"In all seriousness, this is where policing comes to die.
On several occasions I had the bad fortune of visiting this place, and the lack of manners and professionalism of almost every member of staff is striking. Me and my partner tried to report a local incident that involved anti-social behaviour (Im a Lawyer, for your information) and not only was the incident not duly reported, nor attended to, but we were also subjected to the Constables bad sarcasm as he sought to question the credibility of our statement. Not only do they fail to deliver any sense of Community policing, but, indeed, bring down the IQ of the entire area.
SUGGESTION: immediately close this station down pending its conversion into an animal farm, retaining the existing livestock...",1
Dagenham Police Station,"Went into the police station this morning to seek information on a Burgery which happened to me 2 weeks ago. After 2 attempts to contact my assigned officer over the phone to no avail I, in my distressed state, went in person to the station to gain some help regarding my case. The gentleman at the desk was rude and obnoxious and was more interested in chatting up the WPC in the office with him, than helping me with my enquiries!! Very saddened and disturbed at my experience and would advise that the gentlemen in question needs to be advised in customer service skills and victim support knowledge!! I felt like an unimportant human being and left more distressed and frustrated than When I went in. Still waiting for a call back about my case...",1
Charing Cross Police Station,"Met police be ashamed of yourself,
devoting in enforcing a 200 years old law at people
in my experience corrupt police force are working for the corporations and mostly don't know it.
The met have become revenue collectors
THEY FORGET they are public servants Until then- my confidence is at an all time low
The police are now reduced to a reactive service rather than the previously proactive force. Consequently, they have lost control of the streets and their abilities to protect the public.T
HATS WHY some coppers made some big mistakes. They then told big lies to cover those mistakes, and falsified their statements

Exampels: Officer Daniel Richardson 3006
Examples: Officer Thomas Benedict Caulfield 247
are among most corrupt officers in UK",2
